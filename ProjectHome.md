This is a quick & dirty solution to a problem with the native iPhone OS maps application, sending a location by email. It uses the map view provided at http://code.google.com/p/iphone-google-maps-component/ which is a development of a company called [eSpace Technologies](http://www.espacetechnologies.com/).

Hopefully, Apple will someday add this feature in a nice and poluted way to their application, but meanwhile you can use this to do just that.

Pleae note that you need a jailbroken 2.x iPhone to run this program.
